/**

Creating a GUI program that gives the user his/her zodiac sign by entering their date of birth.
Thought process:
what information is needed to find out the zodiac signs. Month and Date.
Month: For 12 months, it is easier to use a ComboBox for the user to select the data instead of 
the user to type in the input. 
Date: Using a textfield to get an integer data

Layout for the program:
Label (Select the month)  : ComboBox for slection of month
Label ( Enter the day)    : Textfield for the day input
                           Description Area
                           Button for execution

A gridpane is excellent to arrange nodes in a grid formation.
